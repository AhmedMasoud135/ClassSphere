## 🏗️ Architecture in 3 Sentences

1. **Frontend** (Next.js) runs in the browser, handles authentication via Firebase, and streams camera frames to backend services.

2. **Attendance Backend** (Flask on port 5000) uses YuNet for face detection and face_recognition library to match students against enrolled encodings stored in Firebase.

3. **Violence Detection Backend** (Flask on port 5001) accumulates 16 frames, extracts features with MobileNetV2, analyzes temporal patterns with bidirectional LSTM, and outputs violence probability.

## 🔑 Key Technologies & Why We Chose Them

| Technology | Why? |
|------------|------|
| **Next.js 15** | Server-side rendering, file-based routing, React Server Components, excellent performance |
| **React 19** | Component reusability, virtual DOM efficiency, huge ecosystem |
| **Tailwind CSS** | Rapid development, consistent design, minimal CSS bloat |
| **Firebase** | Real-time database, automatic scaling, managed auth, generous free tier |
| **Flask** | Lightweight Python framework, easy integration with ML libraries |
| **PyTorch** | Flexible deep learning, excellent community, GPU acceleration |

| **YuNet** | Efficient face detection, handles angles and lighting variations |

---

## 🎭 Face Recognition Process (5 Steps)

```
1. YuNet detects faces → Bounding boxes
2. Extract face regions → Crop images
3. Generate encodings → 128-dimensional vectors
4. Compare with enrolled students → Euclidean distance < 0.6
5. Return matches with confidence → Draw bounding boxes + names
```

**Key Insight**: The 128-dimensional encoding is like a unique fingerprint for each face.

---

## 🛡️ Violence Detection Process (7 Steps)

```
1. Collect 16 consecutive frames → Buffer
2. Resize to 224×224, normalize → Preprocessing
3. MobileNetV2 extracts features → 1,280 per frame
4. Stack into sequence → (16, 1280) tensor
5. BiLSTM analyzes temporal patterns → (512) hidden state
6. Fully connected layer → Probability (0.0-1.0)
7. If > 0.5 → Violence alert
```

**Key Insight**: Violence is detected by motion patterns over time, not individual frames.

## 🔧 Technical Deep Dive (1-Minute Version)

"ClassSphere uses a microservices architecture with three main components. The Next.js frontend handles UI and communicates with two Flask backends via REST APIs. The attendance service uses OpenCV's YuNet model for face detection and dlib's ResNet-based model for 128-dimensional face encodings, matched via Euclidean distance. The violence detection service employs a custom CNN-LSTM hybrid: MobileNetV2 extracts spatial features from each frame, and a bidirectional LSTM analyzes temporal patterns across 16-frame sequences. Firebase Firestore provides real-time data synchronization, while Firebase Storage handles image uploads. The entire system is designed for horizontal scalability and privacy-preserving operation."
